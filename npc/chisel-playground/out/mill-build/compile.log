[warn] /home/tututu/hry/ysyx/ysyx-workbench/npc/chisel-playground/build.sc:34:38: reference to millSourcePath is ambiguous;
[warn] it is both defined in the enclosing object playground and inherited in the enclosing object test as method millSourcePath (defined in trait MavenModuleTests, inherited through parent trait SbtModuleTests)
[warn] In Scala 2, symbols inherited from a superclass shadow symbols defined in an outer scope.
[warn] Such references are ambiguous in Scala 3. To continue using the inherited symbol, write `this.millSourcePath`.
[warn] Or use `-Wconf:msg=legacy-binding:s` to silence this warning. [quickfixable]
[warn]       super.sources() ++ Seq(PathRef(millSourcePath / "test"))
